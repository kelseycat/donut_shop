This is a class project for Codefellows B-33. Images are only used for educational purposes.

The focus of this site is on a randomly generated table that is created with Javascript to predict the amount of donuts that Top Pot will need every hour, for each of their locations.
The input field allows a user to add an additional location to the table by submitting a new location, minimum and maximum customers, and an average donuts per cutsomer.
